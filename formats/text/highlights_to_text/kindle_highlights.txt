Achievable goals: the first step to self-improvement.

I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena where I believed I truly belonged.

You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all—in which case, you fail by default.

You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity.

personal happiness lies in knowing that life is not a checklist of acquisition or achievement.

Life is difficult, and complicated, and beyond anyone’s total control, and the humility to know that will enable you to survive its vicissitudes.

Choosing to live in narrow spaces leads to a form of mental agoraphobia, and that brings its own terrors. I think the willfully unimaginative see more monsters. They are often more afraid. What is more, those who choose not to empathize enable real monsters.

“What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.”

“As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.”
