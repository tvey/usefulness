# Expense counter

Expense tracker apps sometimes offer a data export feature (usually to `.csv` format).

Those who track their expenses can gain useful insights from this data.

Currency of the example (prices) — Russian ruble, but it has does not influence the results.

Description field is a supposed user input that requires cleaning to be helpful.
